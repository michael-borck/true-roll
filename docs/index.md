# Welcome to TrueRoll

TrueRoll is a comprehensive simulation library for ten-pin bowling, designed to model games, analyze player performance, and investigate the impacts of various environmental and personal factors on gameplay.

## Overview

Bowling, as a sport, involves numerous variables that can influence the outcome of a game, from the skill level of the players to the characteristics of the bowling alley. TrueRoll aims to provide a realistic and flexible simulation environment where these variables can be controlled and studied. Whether you're a data scientist, a coach, or a bowling enthusiast, TrueRoll offers tools to simulate, analyze, and understand the nuances of ten-pin bowling.

## Features

TrueRoll includes several key features:

- **Game Simulation:** Simulate complete games with detailed control over player attributes and alley conditions.
- **Scoring Systems:** Support for various scoring systems including traditional, current frame, and 9-pin no-tap.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Tools to analyze game outcomes, providing insights into performance metrics such as strike rates, spare conversions, and overall scores.
- **Data Management:** Integration with a SQLite database to store and retrieve game records, player profiles, and alley specifications for longitudinal studies and performance tracking.
- **Extensibility:** Designed with extensibility in mind, allowing users to add new types of analyses, scoring rules, or even different bowling games like duckpin or candlepin bowling.

## Getting Started

To get started with TrueRoll, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine, along with Poetry for dependency management. Clone the repository, install dependencies, and you're ready to start simulating your own bowling games.

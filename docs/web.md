## Features

### HTMX Integration

The web interface leverages HTMX for dynamic interactions without full page reloads, providing a smooth, modern user experience.

Key HTMX features include:

- In-place form submissions
- Dynamic content updates
- Smooth transitions
- No JavaScript needed for most interactions

### Responsive Design

The interface is fully responsive, providing optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices:

- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

### PicoCSS Styling

The interface uses the lightweight PicoCSS framework for clean, semantic styling.

## Development and Customization

### Creating Custom Routes

You can extend the web interface by adding custom routes to the FastHTML application:

```python
from true_roll.web.app import create_app

app = create_app()

@app.route("/custom-path")
def get():
    return Titled("Custom Page", 
        Div(
            H1("My Custom Page"),
            P("This is a custom page added to the TrueRoll web interface.")
        )
    )
```

### Custom Styling

The application uses PicoCSS by default, but you can customize the styling by adding your own CSS or replacing the default styles.

### Extending Templates

The web interface is based on FastHTML components, which you can extend and customize. See the [FastHTML documentation](https://docs.fastht.ml/) for details.

## API Endpoints

The web interface also provides JSON API endpoints for programmatic access:

### Bowlers API

- `GET /api/bowlers` - List all bowlers
- `GET /api/bowlers/{id}` - Get bowler details
- `POST /api/bowlers` - Create a new bowler
- `PUT /api/bowlers/{id}` - Update a bowler

### Games API 

- `GET /api/games` - List all games
- `GET /api/games/{id}` - Get game details
- `POST /api/games` - Add a new game
- `PUT /api/games/{id}` - Update a game

### Leagues API

- `GET /api/leagues` - List all leagues
- `GET /api/leagues/{id}` - Get league details
- `POST /api/leagues` - Create a new league
- `PUT /api/leagues/{id}` - Update a league

## Security Considerations

The web interface is designed for local network use. If you're exposing it to the public internet, consider:

1. Setting up proper authentication
2. Using HTTPS
3. Placing it behind a reverse proxy like Nginx
4. Implementing rate limiting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   
   If port 8000 is already in use, specify a different port:
   
   ```bash
   trueroll web start --port 8080
   ```

2. **Permission denied**
   
   On Linux/macOS, ports below 1024 require elevated privileges:
   
   ```bash
   sudo true-roll web start --port 80
   ```

3. **Address already in use**
   
   You may already have a TrueRoll web server running. Check with:
   
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep true-roll
   ```
